Learn how to program anywhere! Not only is this site tested on the popular desktop browsers, but it is also designed to work on smaller devices with JavaScript browsers, including the iPhone, the iPod Touch, the Apple iPad, smartbooks (such as the CnMBook, the UbiSurfer, the Disgo Net Browser), and smartphones (such as the Nokia 5800, Symbian Series 60 phones, Google Android based phones, etc).
How To Program has a .IT domain extension so that the domain is easily remembered, where 'it' could either be the programming solution you are trying to create, or 'it' can refer to the IT as in Information Technology.
